# Nulike Coding-Guides

This is where I work out how I want to keep my structure for the whole project of Nulike.

I want to keep this in a separate project where I can keep it public, so I can more easily show it and share it with other people.

## Styleguide

[`styleguide.md`](styleguide.md) has guides for **Naming** and **Structure of CSS**.

All about colors, **Color-palettes** and **Font-colors** are kept in an own [`colorguide.md`](colorguide.md).

## Javascript

Javascript should be written in Coffeescript where possible.
