# Nulike Coding-Guides

This is where I work out how I want to keep my structure for the whole project of Nulike.

I want to keep this in a separate project where I can keep it public, so I can more easily show it and share it with other people.

## Stylesheets

For all the CSS and SASS part I have [`stylesheet.md`](stylesheet.md) where I try to keep that structure.

## Javascript

In the works...
