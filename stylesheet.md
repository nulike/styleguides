## CSS Styleguide

So just that all has it's order, here I will be keeping all rules needed.



###Structure of CSS

First you need to follow the structure used to keep the CSS clear. This follows the ITCSS (Invertred Triangle CSS) approach found [as a slide](https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss). Top to bottom, generic to explicit.

1. [Settings](#settings)
* [Tools](#tools)
* [Generic](#generic)
* [Base](#base)
* [Objects](#objects)
* [Components](#components)
* [Themes](#themes)
* [Trumps](#trumps)

#### Settings

Global variables, config switches.

-
#### Tools

Default mixins and functions.

-
#### Generic

Ground zero styles (normalize.css, resets, box-sizing).

-
#### Base

Unclassed HTML selectors (type selectors).

-
#### Objects

Cosmetic-free design patterns.

-
#### Components

Designed components, chunks of UI.

-
#### Themes

Any themes, just visual overrides (colors, fonts).

-
#### Trumps

Helpers and overrides
